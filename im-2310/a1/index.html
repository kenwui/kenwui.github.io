         <li>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
            <p>I looked at the links but avoided them first
               I clicked the "checklist" buttons above the box with the links to social media
               I tried to interact with the pictures and the gif but there was no response
               I clicked on send me a letter which took me to a new page which displayed a postcard/letter design. Instinctively, I typed on my keyboard. 
               I attempted to type within the borders of the letter even though there was no restriction to type outside of the borders
