      <section>
         <li>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
            <p>The lines and buttons</p> 
         </li><br>  
      </section>

      <section>
         <li>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
            <p>I looked at the links but avoided them first
               I clicked the "checklist" buttons above the box with the links to social media
               I tried to interact with the pictures and the gif but there was no response
               I clicked on send me a letter which took me to a new page which displayed a postcard/letter design. Instinctively, I typed on my keyboard. 
               I attempted to type within the borders of the letter even though there was no restriction to type outside of the borders

      <section>
         <li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
            <p>I spent the most time engaging with the letter and Sandspiel</p>

      <section>
         <li>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?
            <p>My most common action was clicking the left mouse button</p>
         </li><br>

      <section>
         <li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
            <p> I believe the primary goal of the interactive experience is to showcase a general overview of Max's works. The use of buttons and sliders
               ties in very closely with some of Max's projects he has worked on such as "Make Yourself Comfortable with Custom Styling"
            </p>

      <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?
         <p> I am quite impressed with how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal. The buttons and sliders which Max has coded into his
            webpage clearly showcases the multiple projects Max has worked on, from the "First Order Retrievability with Hammerspoon" which talks about shortcut tools
            to "Make Yourself Comfortable with Custom Styling" which talks about manipulating interfaces to suit the style you like.
         </p>
      </li><br>

      <li>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
         <p>
            I began to understand the goal of what Max was trying to communicate through his webpage after reading about the projects he has done. Before which I visited the site 3 times, aimlessly clicked on the buttons and sliders,
            went onto the "Send Me a Letter" and Sandspiel to aimlessly push the keys on my keyboard and mouse button. The message he is trying to communicate 
            does not come right away so the decision to place the link to his projects on the right of "Send Me the Letter" might not be such a good one.
         </p>
      </li><br>

      <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?
         <p>
            In terms of my impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time, I think it fairs rather
            poorly since the message is rather subtle. The first few times when i interacted with the website, I came to the conclusions that:<br>
            <ol>
               <li>It is communicating the message of thinking outside the box</li>
               <li>It is communicating the idea of repetition. That the borders are repeating and the lines and buttons are repeating.
                  Furthermore, the looping video of the plug extention being plugged into itself gives the impression of a loop which 
                  closely ties into the topic of repetition.
