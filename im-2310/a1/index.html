      <li>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li><br>
      <p>The lines and buttons</p>

      <li>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</li><br>
      <p>I looked at the links but avoided them first
         I clicked the "checklist" buttons above the box with the links to social media
         I tried to interact with the pictures and the gif but there was no response
         I clicked on send me a letter which took me to a new page which displayed a postcard/letter design. Instinctively, I typed on my keyboard. 
         I attempted to type within the borders of the letter even though there was no restriction to type outside of the borders
      </p>

      <li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li><br>
      <p>I spent the most time engaging with the letter
      </p>

      <li>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</li><br>
      <p>My most common action was clicking the left mouse button
      </p>

      <li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</li><br>
      <p>I think the primary goal of the interactive experience was to communicate the idea that Max (the creator of the website) 
         is one who "thinks outside the box" and does not restrain himself within borders which is I find is a very smart way to convey this 
         particular attribute of his in the form of border styles
      </p>

      <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</li><br>
      <p></p>

      <li>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</li><br>
      <p></p>
