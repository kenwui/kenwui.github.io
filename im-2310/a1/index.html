               <p>I looked at the links but avoided them first
                  I clicked the "checklist" buttons above the box with the links to social media
                  I tried to interact with the pictures and the gif but there was no response
                  I clicked on send me a letter which took me to a new page which displayed a postcard/letter design. Instinctively, I typed on my keyboard. 
                  I attempted to type within the borders of the letter even though there was no restriction to type outside of the borders

            <li><h4>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
               <p> I believe the primary goal of the interactive experience is to showcase a general overview of Max's works. The use of buttons and sliders
                  ties in very closely with some of Max's projects he has worked on such as "Make Yourself Comfortable with Custom Styling"

            <li><h4>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h4>
               <p> <!--purpose of the portfolio: communicate with students, communicate with other artists, communicate with potential employers, showcase aspects of projects, works etc.--> 
                  I am quite impressed with how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal. The buttons and sliders which Max has coded into his
                  webpage clearly showcases the multiple projects Max has worked on, from the "First Order Retrievability with Hammerspoon" which talks about shortcut tools
                  to "Make Yourself Comfortable with Custom Styling" which talks about manipulating interfaces to suit the style you like.

            <li><h4>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h4>
               <p>
                  I began to understand the goal of what Max was trying to communicate through his webpage after reading about the projects he has done. Before which I visited the site 3 times, aimlessly clicked on the buttons and sliders,
                  went onto the "Send Me a Letter" and Sandspiel to aimlessly push the keys on my keyboard and mouse button. The message he is trying to communicate 
                  does not come right away so the decision to place the link to his projects on the right of "Send Me the Letter" might not be such a good one. <br><br>
                  To expand on the first 2 times I interacted with the website, I found that after clicking on the "X" buttons located on the top right of each article, 
                  I started avoiding it as it permanently got rid of the section and I also found that I avoided interacting with the radial and checklist buttons as it offered very little feedback after interacting with it.

            <li><h4>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h4>
               <p>
                  In terms of my impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time, I think it fairs rather
                  poorly since the message is rather subtle. The first few times when i interacted with the website, I came to the conclusions that:<br>
                  <ol>
                     <li>It is communicating the message of thinking outside the box</li>
                     <li>It is communicating the idea of repetition. That the borders are repeating and the lines and buttons are repeating.
                        Furthermore, the looping video of the plug extention being plugged into itself gives the impression of a loop which 
                        closely ties into the topic of repetition.

                  interacting with each work as you pass them by.

            <li><h4>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h4>
               <p>The most frustrating element of the interaction are the buttons on the main page as I did not feel the feedback was interesting after
                  interacting with them in a number of ways. I tried clicking all the buttons in the hopes that once all the buttons are clicked,
                  there would be an animation or pop-up that would show me something.

            <li><h4>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h4>
               <p>I think the most satisfying element of the interaction would be interacting with "Send Me a Letter". The response to clicking on the
                  "send" button was one that surprised me since we are most familiar to the animation of the letter flying from older versions of computers.
                  However, upon clicking on "send" I found that the letter disintegrated into small grains of sand which could then be erased or increased
                  with the use of the eraser and pen tool respectively.
